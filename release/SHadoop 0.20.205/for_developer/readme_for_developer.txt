This file is write to people who want to study or develop SHadoop.

SHadoop is modified verison a Hadoop. It was developed based on Hadoop source in Eclipse. 
For space limits, Here I can only uploaded all its source code into the src dirctory. 
You can setup a Hadoop develop enviroment and then replace my corresponding java class files to your environment. 
The total git develop environment is about 1GB, if you are interested, please free to contact me. 
I will try to transfer it to you by some means:)
